# IntroductiontoNetworkScience
This repository contains the code for the graded homework for the course Introduction to Network Science for Complex Network Analysis at the University in Bern in fall semester 2020.

Using networkX, this code is able to generate graphs of the ZÃ¼rich road network during a normal and a flooded situation and calculates the betweennesscentrality of each node in both situations.

The code was written by Eva Ammann (eva.ammann@students.unibe.ch) in December 2020 based on the provided course material and code samples.
